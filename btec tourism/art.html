    <img src="/dance/adowa.jpg" alt="" height="400px" width="36%">



    <p>from history that the dance originated in the early days 
of warfare when once the  Great Queen mother of the Ashantis 
 (Abrewa Tutuwaa) was sick and the only way for  her healing was  
 through getting a live antelope from the wild to pacify the gods and 
 make her well again as revealed by the chief priest. The delegation who 
  went to catch this antelope saw the captivating movements of this 
 antelope so they imitated and danced to the entire household how the 
 antelope exhibited such skillful moves on their arrival. The old women 
 also imitated and improvised the moves hence becoming a famous and 
 much-adored  dance amongst the ethnic group and it has been practiced 
 till date. In the past, only women danced Adowa, but today, the men have  
 also mastered the skill and participate. The dance could be a praise dance, 
 a dance to send a warning, a dance to shower insult on someone, a dance 
 to display power and dominance, a dance to convey delight, and so on, depending 
 on what the dancer wants to say to his or her audience. It is performed at 
 weddings,naming ceremonies, funerals, festivals, and the stoolment  and destoolment 
  of chiefs and queen mothers, among other occasions. It is characterized by  moving  
  hands accompanied by footsteps, and the dance frequently conveys a specific message</p>

              and other merry-making events. The root of the dance has been embedded <br>

                called “Borborbor “. He is the grandfather of Borborbor – genius of the genre <br>
                 if there is any recognition of Borborbor today. He fused the original music <br>
                  form,Konkoma with other forms of music 
                genres to the modern Borborbor sound. <br>
                 The genre gained ground and was recognized as one of the popular dance 
              due <br>
               to the hard work of Francis Nuatro as many songs of Borborbor were composed by <br>

               him During a visit to Kpando 
                by Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah,  it was reported that <br>
                 the rhythms of the borborbor 
                 music used at the welcoming ceremony won his heart as he joined the dancing led 
                  by Nuatro group</p>
